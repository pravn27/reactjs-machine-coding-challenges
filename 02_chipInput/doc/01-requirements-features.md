## Problem statement description

- In this task, you are asked to create a Chip Input component that allows users to input a series of tags or keywords. The component will display these tags as "chips" (small labels), which users can add and remove dynamically.

## Features

1. Input Field: Users can type text into an input field.
2. Add chips: When the user presses the "Enter" key, the typed text will be added as a new chip (tag). Empty or whitespace-only chips should not be added
3. Remove chips: Users can delete a chip by clicking the "X" button next to it.
4. Horizontal display: The chips should be displayed in a horizontal list.
5. Persistence: The list of chips should be maintained even when the component re-renders.
